I've updated the member-list.html file to be responsive across different devices:

Added Media Queries for different screen sizes:

Tablet (max-width: 768px)

Mobile (max-width: 480px)

Responsive Table Solution:

Added horizontal scrolling for tables on small screens

Reduced padding and font size on mobile devices

Adjusted Layout Elements:

Smaller headings on mobile

Reduced padding in containers

Adjusted spacing between footer links

Improved Mobile Experience:

Made the logo slightly larger on mobile for better visibility

Reduced border radius for a cleaner look on small screens

These changes ensure the member list page displays properly on computers, tablets, and mobile phones while maintaining its functionality and visual appeal.
